  ALARM NAME  : The distribute fiber is broken or the OLT cannot receive expected optical signals from the ONT(LOSi/LOBi)
  SRVEFF      : SA                   
  PARAMETERS  : FrameID: 0, SlotID: 5, PortID: 12, ONT ID: 17, Equipment ID: XX530v
  DESCRIPTION : The OLT cannot receive expected optical signals from the ONT in four consecutive frames
  CAUSE       : (1) The fiber is broken
(2) The quality of the optical path is poor
(3) The ONT hardware fails           
  ADVICE      : (1) Check tributary optical fiber connection and backbone optical fiber orderly, clean the fiber connector and replace the fiber if necessary
(2) Ensure that the optical attenuation of the optical path is normal
(3) Reset the ONT or replace the ONT
